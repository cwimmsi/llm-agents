   - change_request (Formal proposal for modifications to any aspect of the IT environment,                 such as software updates, hardware replacements, configuration changes or application changes.)
   - problem (Used when investigating the underlying cause of one or more incidents.                 It aims to analyze root causes and prevent recurrence.)
   - incident (Unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of an IT service.                 Restore normal service as quickly as possible.))
2. Set a ticket priority by choosing one of the following options:
   - critical (Urgent issues needing immediate attention, causing major                 business disruption for the entire company or a larger amount of people.)
   - high (Important issues to be addressed soon, potential for                 significant impact for one or a few employees)
   - medium (Standard issues that can be scheduled for regular handling,                 it's the default priority level)
   - low (Minor issues or requests that can be handled when convenient.                 The employee is not blocked by this issue.))
3. Determine the ticket publishers sentiment by choosing one of the following options:
   - positive (User expresses satisfaction or happiness with the service)
